/**
 * characterTypes — the shared vocabulary for the character-animation registry.
 *
 * Pure type/interface declarations (no logic) describing how a character mode's
 * spritesheets are parsed into animations, how the player's cross-mode action
 * keys map onto concrete registry entries, and which modes are wheel-selectable
 * vs. overlay/source-only. The registry pipeline (preload, register, key
 * resolution) and Player.ts both speak in these shapes.
 *
 * Inputs:  none — type declarations only.
 * Outputs: the named types/interfaces below.
 * @calledby the character-mode registry loader/resolver and the player entity.
 * @calls    nothing — a leaf type module.
